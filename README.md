# Approximate 4x4 Bit Multiplier

This repository presents an approximation technique for a 4x4 bit multiplier based on the methods described in the paper [Design and Analysis of Approximate Multipliers](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/368293010). The final implementation satisfies the following criteria:

- **Mean relative error**: Less than 15%
- **Number of LUTs**: Less than 12
- approximations for the approximate compressor were by my own and rest of the approximations are from the described paper.

## Overview

This implementation focuses on the approximation techniques used to optimize a 4x4 bit multiplier for reduced area and power consumption, with acceptable error margins.

### Approximation Techniques Used:
1. **Half Adder Approximation**
2. **Full Adder Approximation**
3. **Partial Product Transformation**
4. **Partial Product Reduction with Compressors**
5. **Final Summation**

## Half Adder Approximation

| A | B | **Exact Sum** | **Approximate Sum** | **Exact Carry** | **Approximate Carry** |
|---|---|---------------|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| 0 | 0 | 0             | 0                   | 0               | 0                     |

## Full Adder Approximation

### Exact Implementation:

- **Carry** = (A ‚ãÖ B) + (B ‚ãÖ Cin) + (Cin ‚ãÖ A)

### Approximated Implementation:

- **Carry** = B

- **Error**: 3 out of 8 cases have errors (3 in Sum and 2 in Carry).

## Partial Product Transformation

The approximation involves the transformation of partial product terms `am,n` and `an,m` into propagate and generate terms:

- **pm,n** = am,n + an,m
- **gm,n** = am,n ‚ãÖ an,m

*Note: Some am,m terms are retained in the transformation.*

## Partial Product Reduction with Compressors

A compressor is used to simplify the partial product tree, processing 4 input bits and a carry-in (Cin) bit. It generates Sum, Carry, and Carry-out (Cout) bits using two approximate full adders.

### Approximated Compressor:

- **Carry** = Cin
- **Sum** = (A ‚äï B) + (C + D)
- **Carry-out (Cout)** = (A ‚ãÖ B) + (C ‚ãÖ D)

  - **Sum mismatches**: 16
  - **Carry mismatches**: 8
  - **Cout mismatches**: 6

## Final Summation

After partial product reduction, the remaining Sum and Carry-out bits are processed using half adders and full adders to generate the final output.
